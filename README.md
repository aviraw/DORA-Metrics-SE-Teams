## Abstract
This research explores the applicability of DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics in evaluating team performance in software development, particularly within software engineering course teams. The primary objective is to analyze how different types of team conflict impact key performance indicators, including:

- Deployment Frequency (DF) – How often teams deploy their software.
- Lead Time for Changes (LTC) – The time taken for a committed change to be deployed.
- Change Failure Rate (CFR) – The percentage of deployments that lead to failure.
- Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) – The time taken to recover from failures.

## Research Problem:
While DORA metrics are widely used in industry to assess DevOps efficiency, their application in educational and course-based software projects remains unexplored. Unlike professional environments, student teams often do not deploy software regularly, leading to challenges in measuring standard DORA metrics accurately. This study aims to explore alternative adaptations of these metrics that can be effectively applied in academic settings.

## Primary Research Questions:
How do different types of team conflict influence DORA metrics in student software projects?
What alternative metrics can be used when direct measurement of DORA metrics is not possible?
How well do these adapted DORA metrics correlate with team performance and project outcomes?
